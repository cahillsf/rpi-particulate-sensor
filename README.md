[Starting point + inspiration](https://www.hackster.io/david-gherghita/air-quality-monitor-using-raspberry-pi-4-sps30-and-azure-03cb42#code)

Submit [Sensirion SPS30](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SPS30) air quality metrics to [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) via a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) running a custom [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) based image.


AWS terraform examples for resources to build the OS image and push it up to S3 object storage.
