## Putting Together an Air Quality Sensor

Fun one to walk through, appreciate your work!  I basically stepped through the instructions exactly as they read, took some notes and meandered a bit along the way.  Took up this project because I had a raspberry pi laying around that I had bootstrapped as a minimal desktop then left gathering dust for a few years.  The idea was to learn something new, get a bit more hands on.  Luckily I did up learning a lot about embedded systems, electrical engineering, and doing some coding that I wouldn't do at my job.  Definitely still learning, we'll see where it goes.  Overall has been very fun, highly recommend stepping outside of your comfort zone.

Also writing this doc from scratch so I don't forgot how to write and type sentences because of easy it is for LLMs to generate tons of content quickly.  Feels a bit slow but that's kind of the point (not a dig at AI at all, love the stuff).
